# Wolfmoji
The Long Dark is a great game. But it has a really bad bug on macOS where wildlife sounds do not play at all. You cannot hear wolves howling, bears shuffling around nearby, and other things that make the game a lot harder than it should be.

The bug has been happening since the initial Darkwalker update (version 1.86, 29 Oct 2020). Hinterland acknowledged the problem but has not yet fixed it.

Wolfmoji provides a visual representation of the wildlife sounds by reading the game's log file and showing emojis for the animals whenever they make a sound.

Usage: Open a Terminal window and run wolfmoji.sh. You can see the output while the game is running by using windowed mode or having your terminal window on another screen.

Advanced usage: Install iTerm2 and set a hotkey for a floating window, so it's always on top of your game.

Pull requests for missing effects, or suggestions for different emoji are welcome!
